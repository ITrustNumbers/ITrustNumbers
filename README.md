Welcome to my Github Profile, This is the home of my curated projects, experiments and some lossely packed ideas. I am mainly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science and other related stuff.   

But recently i am also been quite intrigued by the idea of open source contributions, I am fairly new to the open source landscape and I've just started contributing in some projects. So, If you know some interesting ongoing projects i would love to hear about them.
